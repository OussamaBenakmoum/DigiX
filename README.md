# DigiX

Digix is a graphical simulator of logic circuits, a 3 months working project, designed by a team of 6 students as a part of a module. <br/>
--> [Youtube Video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxuG4MAOG0g&fbclid=IwAR02kJ8JblrgUim53vQ_8IlaGj_bfO7Sgh0C09xM5hx9iHCtdE5rpg29FuM) For demonstration.

# Features: 

-	the simulator provides the user with a set of logic gates (NO, AND, OR, â€¦), combinational circuits (multiplexers, adders ...), and sequential circuits (flip-flops, registers, clock ...) and user created circuits for re-use.
-	Select components and insert them into a workspace (a grid) by Drag-and-drop.
-	Connect the components to form a logic circuit.
-	Make a dynamic visual simulation of the circuit output states according to the input values.
-	Display the truth table of the circuit 
-	Draw the timing diagram of the different signals when it is a circuit comprising sequential components .
-	Save the circuit with the abaility to re-open it later to modify or tu use it as a component of another circuit.
-	A user guide and a Help are also put in disposition of the user. <br/>
